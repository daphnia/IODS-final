data("Boston")

#The variable chas (Charles River dummy variable which is 1 if tract 
#bounds river and 0 otherwise) is integer and is removed from the analysis:

Boston <- dplyr::select(Boston, -chas)

# Note1: 
# rad (index of accessibility to radial highways) is integer 
# and others are numerical. 
# Note2: 
# The variable black gets smaller values as the proportion of black skin 
# colour increases.


# Now, as I have decided to focus on 25 % of the towns 
# that has the most highest crime rates, I remove other observations:  
crim4 <- Boston$crim
bins <- quantile(crim4)
bins
#Then I keep those observations where crim > 3.677083. 
boston_final <- subset(Boston, (crim > 3.677083))
